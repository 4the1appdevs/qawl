WIP Qawl v2

See this issue for the development plan: https://github.com/mr-islam/qawl-svelte/issues/1

Feel free to email me if you are interested in contributing right now, before the foundation is done: navedcoded@gmail.com . Sorry if things are a bit messy, but I recommend checking this repo out a few weeks later!

Use the node scripts `electron-dev` and `pure-dist`, others are there from a template still (to be removed later). I prefer yarn to use yarn so that's the lockfile here.

Old version: https://github.com/mr-islam/qawl

Sorry this readme is bad, making it public quickly in case people want to contribute early â™¥
