WIP Qawl v2

See Notion board for dev plan: https://www.notion.so/naved/0321e2baca694da0947e06000e5d5fdd?v=3c2546b707894ada90801f771dcdafba

Feel free to email me if you are interested in contributing right now, before the foundation is done: navedcoded@gmail.com . Sorry if things are a bit messy, but I recommend checking this repo out a few weeks later!

Use the scripts `electron-dev` and `pure-dist`, others are there from a template still.

Old version: https://github.com/mr-islam/qawl

Sorry this readme is bad, making it public quickly in case people want to contribute early â™¥
